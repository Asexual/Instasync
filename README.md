It's been a fun 3 years, but life's taking me in different directions. I'll miss you guys.

Only the domain was compromised, but just to be safe, I've dumped everyone's user data and wiped everything. Source code will be available.
Working with Go daddy to get the domain transferred back.
The Instasync domain name has been compromised. No servers have been compromised. It's already planned on being open source.
